    <h2>Changing the framework</h2>
        <p>I used a base framework to make my portfolio from, but I changed it in order to make it my own. One way I changed it was I changed the color scheme of the whole site. I also chnaged many of the symbols on the buttons. Another change was I removed many of the sections given because I did not need them as well as restructuring the experience section to instead have it showcase my projects. Also, I added and structured the subsections for each project all on my own. I made several other small changes to the framework but these were the major ones.</p>

        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p> One function that needs work, but is not really an error is when cliking "More" on the cards, the user just appears there rather than having a smooth transition there. I ran out of time to add this functionality for the deadline, but will be adding it after.</p>

    <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
            One aspect of what I did above and beyond is having the skill section. This showcases my skills in a easy to understand and visual pleasing manner. Another aspect of my above and beyond was the navigation added to look through my projects as well as the detials that come up when you click on the project. I also added links to the larger write-ups of each project on their cards and in the larger write-up, links to the project if it was completed.
