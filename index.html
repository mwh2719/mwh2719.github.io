                    Creating a 3D low poly paintball simulator game using Unity. Implementing physics that simulate real world paintball physics as well as adding features to make it more interesting than paintball in the real world. Developing guns such as smg with full auto fire, shotgun, and a paintball RPG that can be picked up from gun spawners around the map. Creating online gamemodes such as free for all battle, team deathmatch, and capture the flag that can be played with friends. I am working on this project alone currently so everything aside from the assests was designed and developed by me.

                    Developed a website from scratch without using any framework or stylesheets other than my own. After creating the website, decided to improve the project further by adding a game to it. The game is drawn to a canvas element on the page. In the game, the player flies a spaceship to avoid alien ships that are attacking it. The player has to shoot and destory all the alien ships in each level to advance. All of the code that runs the game was written by me. I seperated my javascript functions in to different files depending on their purpose. I also make sure to avoid repeating code by making functions for any part of the code that needs to be run more than once.

                <p>
                    Created a web based audio visualizer project from scratch with my own unique features and controls. The code uses ES6 modules and therefore has minimal dependencies between files. There is a javascript file that reads the audio information in real time from the track being played and passes this information to several other files. These files use the audio data to draw different aspects to a canvas element on the page. The user has full control over these elements and can change them to do things such as have the background display dots that move around the canvas randomly and will change size based on the amount of bass and treble at the current moment or display tower speakers that have several different individual speakers on them that change with the bass and treble and, if the amount of bass or treble reaches a certain threshold, will release a randomly colored sound wave that fades as it moves out. There are also several other features that the user can change such as filters that go over the canvas and a frequency booster.

                    Another game design student at RIT and I made this game for a Fear Jam that happened in October. We did not get as far along as we were hoping on it due to limited time, along with other projects being due at similiar times.<br>
                    In the game, you are a character stuck in a maze that is pitch black. You have to use your flashlight to locate the key and then use it on the door in order to escape. The twist is that there is a creature in the maze with you. It is attracted to light, so the longer the light is on the closer the creature gets. The only way to tell how close the creature is is by listening to its noises for when they are getting louder. If you wait too long before turning off the light, the creature will kill you.

                <p>
                    I had to remake the old Atari game "Asteriods" using Unity for a class. For those that do not know, this is a game where you control a ship that has to avoid asteriods that are flying at them endlessly from the edges of the screen. You earn points from shooting the asteriods with your ship's gun. For the project, I had to randomly spawn asteriods off the edges of the screen and have some move in random directions with the majority crossing the screen for at least a moment. I also had to code the movement for the spaceship using velocity, acceleration, and direction vectors. All the collision detection methods had to be written by hand. I had to add bullets firing from the ship and traveling in a straight line when a button was pressed. I did this all from scratch using minimal methods provided by Unity. I also added my own twist to the game and implemented asteriods that would follow the player until the player shot and destroyed them, or was hit by them.

I had the user interact with the given interface search fields in order to narrow the search and return results that met all the given parameters. The user could search based on year, where the rocket was from, who the customer was, and several other fields. The JavaScript would then sort through the results, format the correct ones, and then display them in an easy to comprehend manner to the user.

                    I started this project the summer after finishing my freshman year at RIT. I used this game to teach myself some of the functions of Unity because I knew I would be using it in my upcoming years and I wanted to be ahead. I planned on finishing and releasing the game before heading back to college, but I ran into issues along the way that would slow me down for several days. I now continue to go back and make changes to the game as I learn new aspects of Unity along with better coding standards.<br>
                    This is an endless scroller mobile game. You tap on the sides of your screen to move the character left or right through the gaps in the floor in order to avoid the building that is collapsing above you.

                    I was in charge of leading a team of three other students for a semester in order to complete this project. I had to assign roles and make and maintain a schedule for the project. I also worked on the world and the enemies for the game. The project scoop ended up being narrowed significantly at the end of the semester due to the lose of one group member. This caused all the other members to have to finish all the code he was working on which ended up putting us behind schedule.<br>
                    The objective of the game is to kill all the enemies that are spawned without losing all your lives. You are given a ranged and a melee attack. There are several different types of enemies, all with different abilities.
